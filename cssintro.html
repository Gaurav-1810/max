                Since the day I got to know about MyJio, it is the most used app on my phone. I watch movies, listen to music, play games, read news, make payments, recharge Jio numbers in the family... on MyJio. It’s like a super app.</div>
                
               
           
           

            <div class="king">I was under impression that MyJio is for some premium plan buyers until my friend told me that it is free for every Jio customer. It feels great to be eligible for so many digital experiences just by recharging my mobile number.</div>
        
     
        
        
            <div class="queen">Trust me, I have deleted many other apps from my phone ever since I discovered MyJio. Why would you need to download anything else when a multi-purpose app like MyJio, is on your phone. That saves my phone memory.</div>
        
        
            <div class="dum">My experience with MyJio has been awesome because not once or twice, I have won discount vouchers 3 times from JioEngage in the last one month - all the more reason to use MyJio.</div>
